2 player battleship console game

This C program lets you play a game of battleship with two players. The default gameboard size is 8x8, but you can change the value of BOARDSIZE at the beginning of the C file to make the gameboard bigger or smaller.

Since the original battleship game requires the players to hide their gameboards from the other player, you probably have to play this game against an honest friend who won't peek at the computer screen when it's your turn to play.

When you run the program, you can access further instructions about how to play the game.
Have fun!

Note: I got the SetColor function that changes the console text colour from https://www.codewithc.com/change-text-color-in-codeblocks-console-window/ . All credit for that function goes to the author of that page!
